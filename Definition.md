What is an Algorithms ?
-> An Algorithms is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem

Recipe Analogy

set of well-defined instriuctions to solve a particular problem 

Characteristisc
-- Well defined inputs and outputs
-- each step should be clear and unambiguous
-- Language independent

Why ?
different techniques to efficiently solve those problems

Time and Space Complexity


How to represent Complexity?
-- Asymptotic notations
